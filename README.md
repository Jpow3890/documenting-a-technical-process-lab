# ***How to setup a Inkjet Printer ***

## _step by step guidance_

Brief Summary of instructions

So you just received your new inkjet printer in the mail and you're ready to set it up. First, place the package somewhere reachable on the workbench. Then, place the additional packages such as the toner and/or pack of printing paper beside the printer. Lastly, unpack everything and follow the necessary steps to successfully setting up your printer. Now, after checking to see if the printer is ready for use by allowing it to do a self-diagnois, connecting it to your moniter's wireless network, then performing one test print, you should be good to go!

### Detailed list of steps of the process

1. Organize the new printer packages in workstation such as printer, toner, printing paper, cables, and connectors on the workbench
2. open tray to add printer paper, open panel door to add ink/toner(make sure to always do a little shake and try not to get the ink on your hands), open back panel door to add fuser/roller if not already placed. Depending on the type of printer it may or may not require some additional parts to be checked and to make sure eveything is intact and more importantly functional. 
3. plug in the power supply cable into the back of the printer and into a wall outlet. Then plug in the usb cable to be connected to the computer. If it is wireless then you must log on to the computer's system settings to add the device.
